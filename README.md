From the paper "Helium stars mergers as a route towards intermediate mass stripped stars", Picco et al. (subm, 2026), [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1081800585.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17424084).
I am still adjusting this, for any questions text me at annachiara.picco@kuleuven.be.
Inlists and plotting scripts will be available after publication!
